# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


## Overview

Alphabet Soup is a nonprofit philanthropic foundation dedicated to helping organizations that protect the environment, and improving the lives of the less fortunate. They have tasked us with the assignment to analyze the impact of each donation and vet potential recipients. This will ensure that the foundation's money is being used effectively. But we do live in a inperfect world and not every donation the foundation makes is used in the correct way. In some cases, an organization will take the money and disappear. Alphabet Soup has ask us to predict which or organizations are worth donating to and which are too high risk.


In this analysis we learned and applied:

  •How to build a basic neural network
  
  •Preprocess/prepare the datasets
  
  •Create a training and testing set
  
  •Measure model accuracy
  
  •Add additional neurons and hidden layers to optimize the model
  
  •Select the best model to use for our dataset
  
  
## Results


### Data Preprocessing


  • What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model?
  
        * IS_SUCCESSFUL-was the money used effectively
